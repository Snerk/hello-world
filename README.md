# hello-world
initial test project
I am currently on a military deployment to the middle east.I am going to use my time to learn how to expand my knowledge of these machines we carry around. My goal on this deployment is to learn general tools necessary to implement solutions to everyday practical problems. This includes database management, coding in python, general web development. Eventually, I'd like to earn a CCIE. When I get home, I am going to spend a significant amount of my time toward this goal, which takes an average of about 5 years to complete.
